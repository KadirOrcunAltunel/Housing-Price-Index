# Housing-Price-Index

The housing market plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy for multiple reasons. As an economic indicator, the housing market can signal the health of the current economy. If the housing market performs well, it usually indicates a strong economy. If the housing market is underperforming, it can signal that the economy is stagnating or declining. The housing market is also an essential source of employment, creating thousands of jobs in construction, real estate, and architecture. 

Moreover, the housing market is a component of individual wealth for many people. As the value of property increases, the homeowners can build equity which boosts consumer confidence and spending. The housing market is also a critical government revenue provider, and it creates substantial tax revenue for national and local governments through property taxes, capital gains taxes, and stamp duties. Governments use the income from the housing market to improve infrastructure and public services. 

Lastly, the housing market is closely tied to financial markets. Since mortgages are an essential part of the lending market, a healthy and robust housing market can contribute to the stability of financial institutions. In contrast, a downward trend in the housing market can adversely affect banks and other lenders.

This research aims to determine the effects of macroeconomic factors on the housing market, especially on the house price index. The house price index (HPI) is a statical measure that tracks the changes in the value of residential properties over time.  It is an essential indicator for assessing the overall health of the housing market and general trends in house prices. HPI and macroeconomic factors are closely related, and changes in the broader economic environment can positively or negatively influence HPI. Policymakers, homeowners, investors, and lenders need to make decisions accordingly to HPI data and anticipate any changes that can affect the housing market brought by HPI data.
